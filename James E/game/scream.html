  You picked scream, so the ten men try to duct tape your mouth, but the police officer walks over so they stop
  The officer asks you what has happened and you can either tell the truth and possibly get saved
  or the ten man sitting next to you, Mckracken they call him, could drive away and take you. Or you could just cover
  it up so you have no chance in never being saved. What do you do?
