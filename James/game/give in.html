<h1>YOU PICKED GIVE IN</H1>
<p>
  You picked give in. Now you are in a black van. If you scream the ten man next to you will duct tape your mouth
  and you cant say anything else, but a police officer right there and it would be so easy.
   Just one scream and the police officer will find
you and save you. What do you do?
